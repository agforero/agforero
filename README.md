- 👋 Hi, I’m @agforero!
- 👀 I’m interested in algorithms, AI, historical video games and healthcare technologies.
- 🌱 I’m about to graduate from St. Olaf College with a BA in Computer Science and History. Next year, I'll be earning a MEng in Computer Science from Cornell Tech.
- 💻 I worked with Argonne National Laboratory to develop [a testing framework for bleeding-edge FORTRAN compilers](https://github.com/agforero/FTFramework).
- 🧪 I collaborated with University of Wisconsin-Madison researchers to build [a suite that helps identify key proteins in the COVID-19 infection process](https://github.com/Craven-Biostat-Lab/SARS-CoV-2-Analysis/tree/main/code/GraphAnalysis).
- 🦁 As Chief Technology Officer of St. Olaf's Student Government, I rebuilt our website at [Oleville.com](https://www.oleville.com/) and hosted student elections.
