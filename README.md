- 👋 Hi, I’m @agforero!
- 👀 I’m interested in algorithms, AI, historical video games and healthcare technologies.
- 🐻 I am attending Cornell Tech, the Cornell University campus in New York City, for my MEng in Computer Science. I hold a BA in Computer Science and History from St. Olaf College.
- 💻 I worked with Argonne National Laboratory to develop [a testing framework for bleeding-edge Fortran compilers](https://github.com/agforero/FTFramework).
- 🧪 I collaborated with University of Wisconsin-Madison researchers to build [a suite that helps identify key proteins in the COVID-19 infection process](https://github.com/Craven-Biostat-Lab/SARS-CoV-2-Analysis/tree/main/code/GraphAnalysis).
- 🧑‍🏫 I have taught hundreds of high school students the basics of AI and Python as a Program Manager at Inspirit AI.
- 🦁 As Chief Technology Officer of St. Olaf's Student Government, I rebuilt our website at [Oleville.com](https://www.oleville.com/) and hosted student elections.
